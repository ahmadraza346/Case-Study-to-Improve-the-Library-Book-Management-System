# Case-Study-to-Improve-the-Library-Book-Management-System
 
This study has been performed for the ICT Systems Integration and Management Module at the University of Essex. 
To start with, library staff was interviewed as they were already using the previously deployed system in the library so their experience helped in defining the functionalities for the new Library Management System. Once functionalities were defined, system analysis was performed and use cases were defined.
Following the system analysis, database design was formulated. As part of project management step, elapsed times for team members on related tasks such as designing, programming and documentation were calculated. Gantt chart was finalized to assign tasks in a such way that project can be completed within minimal timespan.
